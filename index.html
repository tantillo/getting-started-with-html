		Unit 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML
	</h2>
	<p>This course introduced me to the basics of the Web and HTML. Here I wrote some simple HTML and a static web page. The unit was taught by <a href="www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> cofounder Steve Huffman.

<p><b>The Basics of the Web:</b></p>
<ul>	
	
<li>
<b>World Wide Web or "Web"</b> is a collection of HTML documents.
</li>

<li>
<b>HTML</b> is Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the basis for almost every webpage.  Hyperlinks or "links" glue these pages together.
</li>

<li><b>Web Browsers</b> such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc. makes requests via the Internet to servers.</li>

<li><b>HTTP</b> is the protocol used by web browsers and servers to communicate with the Web.</li>

<li><b>Servers</b> are computers that host files that interact with internet browsers over the Web. 


</ul>

			
			
			<p><b>What is HTML?</b></p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Text content <b><i>(what you see)</i></b></li>
		<li>Markup<b><i> (what that content looks like or how it is arranged)</i></b></li>
		<li>References to other documents <b><i>(i.e. images and videos)</i></b></li>
		<li>Links to other pages <b><u><i>(i.e. <a href="www.udacity.com">www.udacity.com</a>)</b></i></u>
		<li>Elements in HTML are made up of opening tags, contents, and closing tags.</li>
		<li>Some of the most common stylistic tags used in HTML are the bold tags and "em" tags.  The bold tags does just what it<br>
		says, it makes text bold.  The "em" tag adds emphasis or italicizes words.
		<li>HTML attributes are a tag that equals some sort of value.  One type of HTML attribute is the anchor tag, which is used to create links.
		<li>All text in HTML is rendered as one line, so special tags must be used such as the paragraph tag or the "br" tag to break up text.</li>
		<li>There are two different types of elements in HTML -- inline and block.  Inline merely formats text.  Block actually creates a box with 
		formatting, width, etc.
